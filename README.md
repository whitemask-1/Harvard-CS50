# Harvard CS50x — My Learning Journey

> [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) by Harvard University

This repository documents my progress through Harvard's CS50x course. It contains my lecture notes, problem set solutions, and the final project.

## Course Overview

CS50 teaches the fundamentals of computer science and the art of programming — covering computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and more.
